Rather than sifting through extensive datasets containing results from various European matches, having smaller, league-specific datasets streamlines the process of analysis.\n\nThe dataset comprises columns such as Season, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG (Full-time home goals), FTAG (Full-time away goals), FTR (Full-time result), HTHG (Half-time home goals), HTAG (Half-time away goals), and HTR (Half-time result).\n\nThese results have been sourced from the [site](https://www.football-data.co.uk/spainm.php), a UK-based football betting platform. While they provide datasets for each separate season, I have consolidated them into a single dataset to enhance convenience and usability.\n\n----------------------",
